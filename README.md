This repository demonstrates a common C error: integer overflow. The `bug.c` file contains a simple program that attempts to assign a value exceeding the maximum limit of an integer variable causing potential errors. The `bugSolution.c` file provides a solution to prevent the error by checking the bounds or using larger integer types as appropriate.
